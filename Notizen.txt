    Check if it is a dict
        If yes: check to see if one of the values has "red" in it
            If yes: Write that object into a string (or the numbers in it), then continue with the next iteration
        If not: Check to see if it has further layers
            If yes: Go into that layer and call this function again
            If not: continue with the next iteration
