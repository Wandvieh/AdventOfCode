Sprinkles: capacity 2, durability 0, flavor -2, texture 0, calories 3
Butterscotch: capacity 0, durability 5, flavor -3, texture 0, calories 3
Chocolate: capacity 0, durability 0, flavor 5, texture -1, calories 8
Candy: capacity 0, durability -1, flavor 0, texture 5, calories 8

Looking for the highest score
Score is calculated by
capacity * their amount
    added for all capacities
        multiplied together

The multiplication at the end is the highest for when their numbers are in the middle rather some high and some low
Each ingredient has two properties equaling 0, 1 positive and one negative property

Each of the totals have to be positive, since negative and negative doesn't cancel each other out.
So, there's some rules:
Chocolate has to be higher than Sprinkles and Butterscotch combined
Candy has to be at least 1/5th of Chocolate
    -> Chocolate is the highest, so at least 26
Butterscotch has to be at least 1/5th of Candy
